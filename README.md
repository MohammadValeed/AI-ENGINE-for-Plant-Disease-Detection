# ⭐AI ENGINE for Plant Disease Detection 🌱🤖
* Plant disease detection is crucial for farmers to ensure healthy crop yields. We've developed a deep learning-based system to classify leaf images into 39
  different disease categories. Our model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, built using the PyTorch framework. For training, we utilized
  the PlantVillage dataset.

## ⭐Run Project in your Machine 💻
* You must have **Python3.8** installed in your machine.
* Create a Python Virtual Environment & Activate Virtual Environment [Link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
* Install all the dependencies using below command
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Go to the `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Download the pre-trained model file `plant_disease_model_1.pt` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HrNvhWIDOb5ygQpa0DH7IdRX4wmVzDoP/view?usp=sharing)
* Add the downloaded file in `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Run the Flask app using below command `python3 app.py`
* You can also use downloaded file in `Model` Section and play with it using Jupyter Notebook.

## ⭐Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): 
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing and analyzing image data. They are
  particularly effective in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

## ⭐Testing Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each image has its corresponding disease name, so you can verify whether the model is working perfectly or not
